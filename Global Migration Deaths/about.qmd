*"Remember, always, that all of us, and you and I especially, are descended from immigrants and revolutionists."* — Franklin D. Roosevelt

This is LIM HAAN HOONG Ethan’s final project. It is an attempt to understand and reflect on one of the most urgent humanitarian challenges of our time — migration. Through learning and research, this project seeks to shed light on the stories often left unheard.

Heartfelt thanks to everyone who has supported this journey — teachers, classmates, and all the voices behind the data. Your guidance and compassion have made this work possible.
